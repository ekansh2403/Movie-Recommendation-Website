🎬 Movie Recommendation System
A Python-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar movies based on user input using the cosine similarity algorithm. This project utilizes content-based filtering to recommend movies that are most similar in terms of plot, genre, and other relevant features.

📌 Features
🔍 Recommends movies based on content similarity

🧠 Uses cosine similarity for vector-based movie comparison

🐍 Developed entirely in Python

📄 Clean and simple interface (CLI or basic web interface, if applicable)

⚡ Fast and lightweight

🧠 How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Movie metadata is cleaned and relevant features (e.g., genre, plot, keywords, cast, etc.) are combined into a single string.

Vectorization: The combined text data is transformed into vectors using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer.

Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is used to compute the similarity score between all movie vectors.

Recommendation: Given a movie name, the system returns the top N most similar movies.
